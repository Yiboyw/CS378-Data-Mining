These are linear regression graphs to plot the many factors in deciding whether a basektball team 
would advance in the March Madness tournament such as - home wins, teams wins, free throws attempted, etc. 

**Overall, the most important factor in deciding whether a basektball team would advance in the 
March Madness tournament was the point differential**. 

Point Differential is the numerical gap between points scored and points allowed. 
Wins in close games tend not to reflect a team's true skill. 
Teams that start the season with a better record than their point differential tend to slow down and vice versa.
